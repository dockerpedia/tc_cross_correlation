**Anaconda works on most systems without root access!**

 * [Install Anaconda following the instructions on their site](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

 * **We strongly recommend to work with separate Anaconda environments, and especially not use the special `base` environment** (formerly named `root` on conda versions <4.4; this environment is used for all `conda` commands and environment manipulations, package installations etc.) for anything besides updating the `conda` package itself (if necessary):

```bash
$ conda activate obspy  # this command used to be 'source activate obspy' on older conda versions < 4.4
(obspy) $ 
```
